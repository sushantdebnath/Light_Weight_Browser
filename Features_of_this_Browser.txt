üìä SUMMARY
LightPy Browser is a COMPETENT BASIC BROWSER with:

Solid core browsing experience

Essential tab management

Basic bookmark system

Fundamental download capability

Adequate developer tools access

Good web standards compliance

MAJOR LIMITATIONS:

No advanced privacy/security features

Limited customization options

No sync/cloud capabilities

Basic download manager only

No password management

Limited history features

This browser serves well as a lightweight, educational, or secondary browser but lacks the advanced features needed for primary daily use by power users. It's excellent for learning browser development concepts and basic web browsing tasks.
